  nvidia@agx-orin:~$ jtop -h
  usage: jtop [-h] [--no-warnings] [--restore] [--loop] [--color-filter] [-r REFRESH] [-p PAGE] [-v]

  jtop is system monitoring utility and runs on terminal

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --health              Status jtop and fix (default: False)
    --error-log           Generate a log for GitHub (default: False)

    --restore             Reset Jetson configuration (default: False)
    --loop                Automatically switch page every 5s (default: False)
    --color-filter        Change jtop base colors, you can use also JTOP_COLOR_FILTER=True (default: False)
    -r REFRESH, --refresh REFRESH
                          refresh interval (default: 500)

Options
-------

There are different options available for jtop

Health
^^^^^^

If something goes wrong, you can check the ``jtop`` status with

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo jtop --health

.. image:: /images/jetson_config-02-jtop.png
   :align: center

This tool, will check and fix:

- **jetson-stats** - Fix jetson-stats service
- **Permissions** - Fix permissions for your user
- **variables** - Check if are installed all variables :doc:`/other-tools/environment_variables`

Restore
^^^^^^^

If you want to restore the original board configuration you can simply write

.. code-block:: bash

  jtop --restore

.. image:: /images/jtop-restore.png
   :align: center

This command will restore the original configuration of:

- ``jetson_clocks``
- fan
- ``nvpmodel``
- jtop configuration

Color filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option change the red color for text and background to blue.

To enable this feature you can add this option

.. code-block:: bash

  jtop --color-filter

or you can add in your ``.bashrc``

.. code-block:: bash

  JTOP_COLOR_FILTER=True

The output will be like the image below

.. image:: /images/jtop-color-filter.png
   :align: center

Error-log
^^^^^^^^^

If your board is not included, jetpack missing, hardware missing, you can launch this script

.. code-block:: bash

  jtop --error-log

This script generate a file ``jtop-error.log`` ready to be attached on your issue

Pages
-----

**jtop** have four different pages to control your NVIDIA Jetson:

1. **ALL** Are collected all information about your board: CPUs status, Memory, *GPU*, disk, fan and all status about jetson_clocks, NVPmodel and other
